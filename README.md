# RHScomms

This will be a place for files relating to the RHS Magnet Communications Program studio can be stored.

We will be updating this file as much as possible before I graduate in 2024. I am aiming to share all of my knowladge here to help ensure future students can use this to trouble-shoot problems they have in the studio.
My contact information can be found in the studio around the doors. Please feel free to email or text me if you have any questions.
